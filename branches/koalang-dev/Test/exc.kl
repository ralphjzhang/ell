' Exceptions
' Accessing an unkown variable raise an error, which stop the execution of the program
' To prevent that you can use the ? prefixed operator to catch the error:
? undefined_variable

' You can raise your own errors with ! prefixed operator.
' Here, catching and raising at the same time has null effect:
?! "Bad bad bad"

' An error is typically a couple id/message, which can be printed or stored into a variable:
print ? b
error = ? b

' You can test the error:
if error
    print "Variable b is undefined, ok, go on"
else
    ! "Hum. Variable b SHOULD be undefined"

' Notice that you can raise whatever complex object you want:
' (but ! operator is unary so you must group your arguments into a list)
code = 312
?! ("bad" (2 "Bad bad bad..." "It is very very bad, really") code)

' Selective exception catching is not supported, but you can reraise an error like this:
error =? b
if error[0] != "TypeError"
    ! error
