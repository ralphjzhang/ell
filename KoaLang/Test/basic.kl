' Basic Types

' KoaLang shoud be intuitive for any person who knows a kind of basic programming language:

a = 112
print a + 3 / 5

' This will print 112.60. Every numbers are double-precision floating point.

' KoaLang has dynamic typing, for exemple you can now assign a text string into ''a'':
a = "hello, world"
print a

' A list is just a bunch of objects, but you must use brackets to group them:
l = ( a  1  "hey, you!" )
print l
