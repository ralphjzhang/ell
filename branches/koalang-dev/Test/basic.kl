' Basic Types

' KoaLang shoud be intuitive for any person who knows a kind of basic programming language:

a = 112
print a + 3 / 5

' This will print 112.60. Every numbers are double-precision floating point.

' KoaLang has dynamic typing, for exemple you can now assign a text string into ''a'':
a = "hello, world"
print a

' A list is just a bunch of objects, but you must use brackets to group them:
l = ( a  1  "hey, you!" )
print l


' To acquire a string typed on keyboard, use the input function:
age = input "What is your age ? "



' To evaluate a string as a piece of koalang code:

a = 1
b = 2
eval "print a + b" @@


' Or you can give the context:

dict = { a:1  b:2 }
print eval "a+b" dict
